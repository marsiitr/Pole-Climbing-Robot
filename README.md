## B. Abstract
### Pole climbing robot utilizes a rack and pinion system to perform vertical motion up and down a pole, with the caterpillar motion of the top plate and bottom plate. The robot can climb up the poles within a certain range of diameters.

## C. Motivation
### Electricians and workmen have to climbup an electric pole in case of a malfunction, this leads to several accidents. This can be avoided if a robot can be made to climb the pole and perform specialised functions. As a first step towards that, this robot has been designed to climb a pole. It can also be used for surveillance and fruit harvesting.

## D.Mechanical Aspect of the Design
### The robot consists of a top plate is connected to the pinion and a clamp whereas the bottom plate is connected to the rack and the lower clamp. The clamp is 3d printed and is specifically designed for this purpose. It is padded with a soft gripping rubbery material. It's grip is loosened or tightened using the motion of a lead screw. The two plate system is stabilised by two rods which pass through the top plate through linear bearings and are connected to the bottom plate.

## E. Electronics Aspect of the Design
### The micro-controller used is Arduino UNO and Cytron motor drivers. The pinion is rotated by a DC motor with an encoder. The lead screw of the clamp is rotated by a DC motor with an encoder. 

## F. Cost Structure (In Rupees)

### 2. Encoder			1500 X3		4500
### 3. DC motor 		300 X2		600
### 4. Cytron MDD 		1700 X2		3400
### 5. Lead screw 		450
### 6. Brass Rod 		80
### 7. Linear Bearing 	170 X2		340
### 8. Circular Bearing 40 X2		80
### 9. 12 V battery		1500 
### 10. Miscellaneous	300
###     Total =			11,750

## G. Applications
### 1. Fruit harvesting
### 2. Painting poles
### 3. Cleaning lamp post
### 4. Accessing wind turbines or street light for inspection
### 5. Surveillance
### 6. Fix Telecom cables

## H. Limitations
### 1. The lead screw mechanism is slower than we'd desire.
### 2. The rack and pinion is slightly slower than the faster actuators like hydraulic and pneumatic.
### 3. The clamp design limits the width of the rod that can be climbed.
### 4. The bot's weight increases because of the several actuators and other parts.

## I. Future Improvement
### 1. Design a prototype at big size, which can be used for pole with different diameters and high payloads capability
### 2. Replace the grippers with a better gripping mechanism ( Ex: Soft robot gripper or more number of grippers to climb poles of any texture and diameter)
### 3. Remotely control the robot from a smart device.
